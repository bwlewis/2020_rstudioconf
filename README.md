# Foreach, future and parallel computing with R 

Slides from my talk honoring the work of Steve Weston at the 2020 RStudio
conference in San Francisco, https://rstudio.com/conference/.

When the video is available I'll put a link to it here; these slides don't make
much sense on their own.

The separate.html file are the slides independent of the separate image files
(also in this repository).

The index.html file is a single, self-contained HTML document with everything
embedded in it.

These slides use my minimalist https://github.com/bwlewis/slides HTML slides template.
